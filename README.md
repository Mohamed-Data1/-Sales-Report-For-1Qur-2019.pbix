📊 Power BI Sales Analysis Project 
As part of my hashtag#DataAnalytics journey, I built a sales dashboard using hashtag#PowerBI with:
🔹 Key Metrics:
✔ Total Sales
✔ Gross Income
✔ Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)
🔹 Interactive Insights:
📍 Sales by City, Branch & Product Line
📍 Trends by Customer Gender
📍 Monthly Performance Tracking
🎯 Goal: Turn dataset into a clear, actionable overview using Power BI visuals.
